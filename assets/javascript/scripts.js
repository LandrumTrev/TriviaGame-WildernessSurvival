            question: "Halfway into a weeklong hike in Glacier National Park, you and your buddy have lost the trail. What's your next move?",
            answer: "B. You have company, supplies, and gear—so solve this yourself. If you're still off the trail after a day or two, try C. Following option A is a major reason hikers get lost.",
            correct: "B",
            A: "A. Shortcut cross-country back toward the path, to avoid wasting daylight.",
            B: "B. Retrace your steps to your last known landmark.",
            C: "C. Stop, pitch your tent, and start signaling for help.",
            D: "D. Climb to the top of the highest nearby peak to get a better view.",
        },


        {
            question: "It's day 8 of your thru-hike of southern Utah's 812-mile Hayduke Trail, your water bottles are empty, and the map doesn't show any springs on this high plateau. Now what?",
            answer: "B. While urine can be 95 percent water and only 5 percent waste, concentrated urine can increase thirst, mess up your electrolytes, and induce vomiting. C is a myth.",
            correct: "B",
            A: "A. Drink any urine you produce.",
            B: "B. Rest in the shade, then retrace your steps to the last available water once the sun goes down.",
            C: "C. Find a creekbed and start digging. You'll find the water table soon.",
            D: "D. Follow a cattle trail; it will always lead to water.",
        },


        {
            question: "You're ready for the first rappel into a technical slot canyon, but the anchors mentioned in the route description aren't there. Is this a problem?",
            answer: "C. Flash floods may have stripped anchors you need, or you might be in the wrong canyon. Either way, a slot canyon is usually a one-way trip, so make sure you can get through before proceeding.",
            correct: "C",
            A: "A. No. Rap on using something else as an anchor, but make sure your cell phone is charged in case anything goes wrong.",
            B: "B. Not really. But first, check your bolt kit to be certain you have enough anchors to pound in wherever you might need them, and find a good spot to establish the start of your own route.",
            C: "C. Yes. Retrace your route until you find the anchors.",
        },


        {
            question: "True or false? Hypothermia can be a risk in temps above 55°F.",
            answer: "A. True, especially if it's raining and windy. Just ask the rangers in the Smokies, who see a surprising number of cases every spring.",
            correct: "A",
            A: "True",
            B: "False",
